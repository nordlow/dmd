`new` can now allocate an associative array

This allows two associative array references to point to the same
associative array instance before any keys have been inserted.

---
int[string] a = new int[string];
auto b = a;
...
a["seven"] = 7;
assert(b["seven"] == 7);
---

Note: Calling `new` is not needed before inserting keys on a null
associative array reference - the instance will be allocated if it
doesn't exist.
